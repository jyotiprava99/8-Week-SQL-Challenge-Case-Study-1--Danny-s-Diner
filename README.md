```sql
 WITH points_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    m.product_id, 
    CASE
      WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
      ELSE price * 10 END AS points
  FROM menu m
)

SELECT 
  s.customer_id, 
  SUM(points_cte.points) AS total_points
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN points_cte
  ON s.product_id = points_cte.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi ‚Äî how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
      join_date, 
      join_date + 6 AS valid_date, 
      DATE_TRUNC(
        'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)
        + interval '1 month' 
        - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM members
)

SELECT 
  s.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
    WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * m.price END) AS points
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON s.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND dates.join_date <= s.order_date
  AND s.order_date <= dates.last_date
INNER JOIN menu m
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

#### Answer:

**Rank All The Things**

**Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**

```sql
WITH customers_data AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.order_date,  
    m.product_name, 
    m.price,
    CASE
      WHEN mb.join_date > s.order_date THEN 'N'
      WHEN mb.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'
      ELSE 'N' END AS member_status
  FROM sales s
  LEFT JOIN members mb
    ON s.customer_id = mb.customer_id
  INNER JOIN menu m
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT 
  *, 
  CASE
    WHEN member_status = 'N' then NULL
    ELSE RANK () OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id, member_status
      ORDER BY order_date
  ) END AS ranking
FROM customers_data;
```

#### Answer: 
| customer_id | order_date | product_name | price | member | ranking |
